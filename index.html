    <p>Abstract: Esophageal speech (ES) is a pathological voice that is difficult to understand. Besides that, it 1
is difficult to obtain the recordings of the patient’s voice before the laryngectomy, which complicates 2
enhancing this kind of voice. That is why the most supervised methods used to enhance ES are based 3
on voice conversion, which uses healthy speaker targets, thing that may not preserve the speaker’s 4
identity. Otherwise, unsupervised methods for ES are mostly based on traditional filters, which 5
cannot alone beat this kind of noise, making the denoising process difficult. Also, these methods are 6
known for producing musical artifacts. To address these issues, a self-supervised method based on 7
the Only-Noisy-Training (ONT) model was applied, consisting of denoising a signal without needing 8
a clean target. Four experiments were conducted using Deep Complex UNET (DCUNET) and Deep 9
Complex UNET with Complex Two Stage Transformer Module (DCUNET-cTSTM) for assessment. 10
Both of these models are based on the ONT approach. Also, for comparison purposes and to calculate 11
the evaluation metrics, the pre-trained VoiceFixer model was used to restore the clean wave files of 12
Esophageal Speech. Even the fact that ONT-based methods work better with noisy wave files, the 13
results have proven that ES could be denoised without the need for clean targets, and hence, the 14
speaker’s identity is retained.</p>
